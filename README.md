# HackViolet2023
HackViolet is a 24-hour hackathon hosted by The Association of Women in Computing, a student-run, non-profit organization at Virginia Tech. Through the event, we encourage all individuals to learn about and become change agents for the gender gap in technology by innovating and inspiring with code.

# What ViMap Does :earth_americas:
**ViMap** is an application that displays aggregated data on a 3-dimensional globe that has the ability to be controlled with 
a user's hand movement captured from a webcam.

# Why Was ViMap Developed :rocket:
**ViMap** was developed to visualize various data sets 3-dimensionally without the need to use any computer input. We 
wanted to allow our data-visualization to be accessible to as many people as possible

# How Did We Develop ViMap :construction:
**ViMap** was developed using a pre-trained *OpenCV* model to capture hand movement and gestures paired with a *flask* app that utilizes *plotly-dash*
to create a viewable 3-dimensional globe.

# Challenges We Ran Into :stop_sign:
Throughout the development of **ViMap** our team encountered issues with
- Creating and joining multiple threads
- Optimizing *OpenCV* Hand Tracker performance
- Optimizing the web application
- Creating a a transfer-of-data connection between the main and secondary threads

# Accomplishments We Are Proud Of :heavy_check_mark:
Throughout the development of **ViMap** our team came together to accomplish
- Integrating I/O
- Addition of datasets
- Rendering the globe figure
- Ability to control the globe with hand movement and gestures

# What We Learned :computer:
The development of **ViMap** allowed us to refine and learn skills various technical skills
- Implementing machine learning models
- Multithreading
- Web application using *flask*
- Parsing economic data

# What's Next for ViMap :world_map:
Our development team expects to implement additional datasets, real-time entity tracking, and further optimizing the *OpenCV* model

# How To Start :snake:
Make sure you download the following Python libraries 
- *flask*
- *dash*
- *dash-bootstrap-components*
- *tensorflow*
- *opencv-python*
- *mediapipe*

Then
- Run app.py
- Open the *flask* web-application
- Move your hand around in a ***closed fist*** gesture to rotate the globe
- Additionally, the globe may be rotated using the buttons on the web-application
